                A counter is set to 4. The <code>before-change</code> function
                returns <code>false</code> as long as the counter is not down to
                0. When you click on a button, the counter decreases by one.

            <p>
                The <code>before-change</code> function logs a message in the
                console when you click on a button. It does not prevent you from
                changing steps.
